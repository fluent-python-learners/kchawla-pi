Python stores all numbers as floats and converts them as needed.
array.array is a great way to store numerical data

pickle is also super efficient but can handle all data types.
    Pickling (serialization, marshalling, flattenning) is converting an object into a bytestream and unpickling is
    constructing the object structure from the bytestream.
    pickle is not good for highly nested objects, it has a limit to how much it can nest.
    Then it fails to pickle correctly. Atleast not json pickle.
    5-6 hierarchies is pushing it.
marshal is similar to pickle module, but thats used for pyc files. Not a good way to store persistent data.
    use pickle or shelve for that. Marshal is hardware arch indeoendent.
shelve is a persistent dict like obj, which unlike dbm can store any kind of obj in value.
    maybe one can do an in memory db using.
    can not do concurrent read and write.

with statement.

A view is a db table frozen in time in a rdbms.

The append and popleft operations are atomic, so deque is safe to use as a LIFO queue in multithreaded applications without the need for using locks.
